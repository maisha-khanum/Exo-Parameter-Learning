This folder contains the data used to train the data-driven model from the real-world exoskeleton optimization study (https://rdcu.be/cZqEe). The training data is provided in the "training_data.npy" file. The training data size is 5180 by 64. The number of rows represent the number of training examples. Each training example consists of four values for the torque parameters, 30 values for the left ankle angle discretized across the gait cycle, and 30 values for the discretized ankle velocity across the gait cycle. These 64 values were computed by taking the difference between two assistance conditions, subtracting the 64 values of the second assistance condition from the 64 values of the first assistance condition. The training labels are provided in the "train_labels.npy" file. The training labels have a shape of 5180 by 1, where the label for each row of data is either a '0' or '1'. A '0' represents that the first exoskeleton condition had a lower metabolic cost than the second exoskeleton condition. A '1' represents that the second exoskeleton condition had a lower metabolic cost than the first exoskeleton condition. 

A sample script "model_training.py" is provided to illustrate how to load the data and train a logistic regression model. We hope these resources help to provide more information about the process for training these models, and to provide additional information for reproducing this study. To use the original dataset for more complex or custom applications, you can access the raw data from the original study (https://doi.org/10.1126/scirobotics.abf1078).

Differences in versions of the software packages may produce slightly different trained models. This package was tested with Python 3.5, numpy 1.14.5, and scikit-learn 0.17.
